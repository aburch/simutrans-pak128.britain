# 4x 35hp motors (guessed): the caption to this photograph: http://www.flickr.com/photos/ingythewingy/11017240334/
# suggests that they had 35hp motors; but this was the era of the 60hp motor *and* these trams were
# intended to be especially powerful to deal with "hilly routes" (hence "HR"). The only sensible deduction, therefore
# is that these had *four* 35hp motors - one for each wheel, so as to maximise both power and tractive effort.
