# See Hamilton Ellis p. 41 and Plate 6 III
# (between pages 31-32). This is probably a
# Craven coach from the later 1840s, built
# as fourth class after the 1844 Act.
# 
# This five compartment vehicle would not
# be the same as the 17ft open carriage
# built as joint stock with the SER, 
# described at p. 35 of Hamilton Ellis.
