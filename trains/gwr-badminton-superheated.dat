# NOTE: The 3d model for this locomotive is part of the gwr-bulldog.blend
# file, which is intended to make up many different GWR outside frame
# 4-4-0 classes. The correct configuration for this locomotive (in each
# livery) is as follows:
#
# Layer 1 (common parts)
# Layer 5 (6ft 8 1/2 in. wheels)
# Layer 6 (wide cab)
# Layer 8 (curved frames)
# Layer 9 (standard no. 2 boiler)
#
# NB: The layer numbers in Blender are confusing. The numbers given above
# are the numbers that can be selected using the number keys. However, in 
# some contexts, such as in scripting, the numbers are reported as -1 the
# above numbers, so that the lowest layer number is 0, not 1. The above 
# numbers assume that the lowest numbered layer is 1.
