# Is this lower correct? The article suggests that these horses were "prized for their ground-covering ability", and could trot at 20mph and 50 miles in a day -
# but it is unclear whether these were pulling a carriage or merely being ridden. It seems to make more sense for these slightly smaller horses, less coach
# horses than cab horses, to have a shorter range than the true coach horses. Players have been observed using them instead of Fresians when their range 
# was the same as that of the Fresian at 30km.
