In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, methane for street lighting and cooking was manufactured from coal in gasworks.  Byproducts included coal tar, which was used for medicine and for paving roads, but is now considered toxic waste.  Manufactured gas was replaced by natural gas in the middle of the 20th century.
