# Private car ownership over different years. The numbers other than years are
# percentages, and should be integers (i.e., no decimal point).

# This website has good modern data, but only two data points: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/transport-institute/pdfs/transport-poverty
#
# Figures before 1951 and after 2012 are educated guesses. Data are for the UK:
# other countries might vary.
#
# This is indexed by passenger class (as of July 2017). 0 is the lowest and 4 the highest. Much of the quintile data are extrapolated as accurate data are hard to find,
# especially for the higher income qunitiles. Note that the classes are not intended to represent actual income qunitiles, especially the highest classes.
