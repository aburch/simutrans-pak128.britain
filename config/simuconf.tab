# These settings determine how vehicles take corners, for each individual type of way.  They
# only apply to vehicles that use fixed ways (road, rail, monorail, etc.), and not aircraft or
# ships. Note that these settings have changed substantially from versions earlier than 11.
# 
# corner_force_divider_[way type]: The maximum force as a proportion of G (gravitational force)
# that it is permissible for vehicles of this way type to experience when taking a corner. This
# number is expressed as a divider: e.g., a value of 10 is 1/10th of G, or 0.1G. The higher this
# number, the slower that vehicles have to travel in corners. 
#
# The explanation for this formula can be found here:
# https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NbYqQSQcE2MC&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=curve+radius+speed+limit+formula+rail&source=bl&ots=mbfC3lCnX4&sig=qClyuNSarnvL-zgOj4HlTVgYOr8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sBGwVOSGHMyBU4mHgNAC&ved=0CCYQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=curve%20radius%20speed%20limit%20formula%20rail&f=false

# the order of the vehicles. These will generally take the least time to reverse.
#
# "hauled_reverse_time_seconds" refers to trains/convoys that cannot be driven from the

# to the rear, but where that locomotive can itself be driven in either direction,
# so that it does not need to turn around.

# around to face the other direction (such as steam locomotives with tenders) at the
# end of the journey. These will genearlly take the most time to reverse.
#
# All times are in game seconds. In previous versions, these were specified in internal
# milliseconds by "unit_reverse_time" (etc.) without "_seconds", but these values
